# grassplain

an (unserious) command line argument parser generator, for when argparse is too much and too slow

## what are the features?

- uses a utf-8 encoded [toml file](example-meadow.toml) to define the arguments and options

- generates a single python file that you can use as a module or insert into your project \
  (note: insertion is not a feature)

- returns a [typed NamedTuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)
  with the parsed arguments

- supports what you'd expect for basic usage:
  - positional arguments
  - short and long options
  - flags/boolean options \
    (these are actually parsed into integers, e.g., `-v` is `1` and `-vvv` is `3`. ints in python
    are falsy-truthy so it's fine)
  - flag stacking \
    (e.g., `-abc value` is the same as `-a -b -c value`)
  - help and version flags
  - honours `--` to stop parsing options
  - subcommands + `subcommand --help`
  - nested subcommands \
    (e.g., `subcommand subsubcommand --help`)

- **however,** grassplain does NOT know about your code, so you check for types after the fact

## frequently questioned answers:

- **but why?**

  argparse is slow... (enough so for my use case in which i still had to use python, ahem)  
  and if i was going to write a cli parser for a project, hell, why not make it a bit generic?

- **why toml?**

  for this use case it's pretty good, i'd say

- **why should i use it?**

  you probably shouldn't, but if you aren't doing anything too fancy and want an argument parser
  that is:
  
  - a) quick and dirty (see 'why should i NOT use it?')
  - b) ahead-of-time, so parsing starts when code execution starts

  this might \~just~ work for you

- **why should i NOT use it?**

  grassplain is neither fully featured, batteries-included, or battle-tested tool. it exists for my
  own use case, and that's about it — i'm not trying to beat argparse, click, or typer. just doing
  my own thing (❁´◡`❁)

## cool, how do i use it?

1. install with `pip install grassplain` (or use pipx)

2. read the example file, understand it and modify it/create your own

3. run `grassplain path/to/your/config.toml > custom.py` to generate the parser

    for this example, let's use the following really basic config:

    ```toml
    [global.arguments.target]
    description = "witty example description here"
    ```

4. and do something like this in your code:

    ```python
    from ... import parse_args, Arguments
    import sys
    
    def _show_version() -> None:
       print("v0.16.7")
       sys.exit(0)

    # generated_parser.Behaviour is a typed NamedTuple
    args: Arguments = parse_args(sys.argv, version_function=_show_version)
    print(args.target)
    ```

    (remember to modify the import statement! [and the _show_version function, if needed])

5. et voilà :)

   ```text
   $ python example.py help
   usage: example.py [-h] [-v] TARGET
   
   positional arguments:
     TARGET    witty example description here
   
   global options:
     -h, --help     show this help message and exit
     -v, --version  show program's version number and exit

   $ python example.py "don't be sad. the time is coming. and then we'll rest."
   don't be sad. the time is coming. and then we'll rest.
   ```

   (honestly if you only have one argument, you might as well just use `sys.argv[1]` — but feel free
   to use grassplain to generate the help message!)

## could it be better?

1. yeah, it's currently \~reeealllly~ naively written

2. i mean, this \~is~ an open source project 
   (open an issue or a pull request if you want to help make it better! :D)

3. the 'backend' is modular, so i don't know, eventually i (or you!) could write a variant that
   outputs zig or anything else

## what's the configuration file structure?

```toml
[meta]
description             = "<description here>"  # required!
max_line_length         = 80
min_description_padding = 12
max_description_padding = 25

[metas.extra]
"<header>" = "<body text>"

[global.arguments."<argument name>"]
description         = "<description here>"  # required!
number_of_arguments = 1  # set to -1 for unlimited

[global.options."<option name>"]
description = "<description here>"  # required!
delimiter   = ""  # if set to anything else, will split the value by this delimiter
                  # for escaping the delimiter, use a backslash before it:
                  #   (e.g., `--text "Now then\, let’s compare answers."`)
                  # you can also escape backslashes with another backslash
                  #   (e.g., `--path "K:\\DCIM\\Camera,K:\\Pictures"`)
                  # note: if no delimiter is given, arguments are treated as-is
                  # note: when reading, if a delimiter was given,
                  #         the resulting argument is a list[str]
default     = ""  # note: when reading, if the value is empty, then the option was not set

[global.flags."<long flag name>"]
description = "<description here>"  # required!
short       = "<short flag character>"
default     = 0  # flags are treated as integers, so 0 is the default value
                 # (0, for false/the flag not being set/used)

# defining subcommands
[subcommands."<subcommand name>"]
description = "<description here>"  # required!

# args/opts/flags of subcommands are defined just like their global counterparts
[subcommands."<subcommand name>".arguments."<option name>"]
[subcommands."<subcommand name>".options."<option name>"]
[subcommands."<subcommand name>".flags."<option name>"]

# subcommands can also have their own subcommands
[subcommands."<subcommand name>".subcommands."<subcommand name>"]
description = "<description here>"  # (still) required!
```
